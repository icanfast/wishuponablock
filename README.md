# Wish Upon a Block

This repo is based on a Tech with Tim course: https://youtu.be/zfvxp7PgQ6c

## How to play

Open terminal

Run `python -m pip install pygame`

Wait for installation to finish

Make sure you're within the repo directory

Run `python tetris.py`

## Why to play

This iteration is meant to **gather data** on typical games of Tetris. Not t-spinning/PC/PvP/comboing for now, just striding like in classic Tetris. Cheese is ok, mistakes are welcome. Your games will be saved in the snapshots directory. After playing a few games please zip the snapshots directory and send it to me. It's going to be very useful to the project, thanks!
