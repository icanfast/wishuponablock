# Wish Upon a Block

## Why to play

This iteration is meant to **gather data** on typical games of Tetris. Not t-spinning/PC/PvP/comboing for now, just striding like in classic Tetris. Cheese is ok, mistakes are welcome. Your games will be saved in the snapshots directory. After playing a few games please zip the snapshots directory and send it to me. It's going to be very useful for the project, thanks!
