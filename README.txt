How to play(Mac and Linux(probably Windows too but not sure)):

open terminal

python -m pip install pygame

wait for installation to finish

make sure you're within this directory

python tetris.py


This iteration is meant to gather data on typical games of Tetris (not t-spinning/PC/PvP/comboing for now, just striding like in classic Tetris, cheese is ok, mistakes are welcome). Your games will be saved in the snapshots directory. After playing a few games please zip the snapshots directory and send it to me. It's going to be very useful to me, thanks!
