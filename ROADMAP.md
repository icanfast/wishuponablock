Here is the list of features in the backlog, with corresponding "impact score" (1-5) — the importance of the feature in my judgment. Generally the more the score, the sooner I'll get to it
## Gameplay
- Game Modes (Sprint, Classic etc) — 5
- Scoring — 5
- Replays — 3
- Refiew top-out behaviour. Make it more lenient like in tetrio/jstris — 4
- Wish Upon a Bag — a less intrusive ML piece generator that shuffles the next 7 bag to try and help — 4
- For Wish Upon a Block generator display the probabilities with which the piece was generated, basically the network outputs — 4
- For Wish Upon a Block generator maybe it is possible to display the most likely next piece. Will require completely new ML pipeline — 1
- Bots — 2
- RL bots and piece generators — 1

## UI/UX
- Gameplay Settings (DAS, ARR, gravity etc) — 5
- Visual/Accessibility Settings (gridlines, contrast, colourblind mode) — 5
- Resize Settings — 4
- Patch Notes — 3
- Background Music — 3
- Sound Effects for scoring/game over, etc — 4
- Logo for the main screen — 2
- Favicon — 3
- In game stats — PPS, Attack, Finesse — 3

## Labeling and ML
- Grid Constructor — 5
- Snapshot Explorer — 4
- Unsupervised learning (press "Hold" = don't want that = negative signal?) — 2
- Opt-out of data collection toggle — 5

## Personalization
- User authentication + profile + stats — 2
- Personalized ML generators (this is a big one, but also a big one, you know...) — 2
