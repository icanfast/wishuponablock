Here is the list of features in the backlog, with corresponding "impact score" (1-5) — the importance of the feature in my judgment. Generally the more the score, the sooner I'll get to it

## Gameplay

- Replays — 2 // lowered priority, blocked by personalization
- Wish Upon a Bag — a less intrusive ML piece generator that shuffles the next 7 bag to try and help — 4
- For Wish Upon a Block generator maybe it is possible to display the most likely next piece. Will require completely new ML pipeline — 1
- Bots — 2
- RL bots and piece generators — 1

## UI/UX

- Patch Notes — 3
- Background Music — 3
- Favicon — 3
- In game stats — PPS, Attack, Finesse — 3 // lowered priority due to need in unified UI design
- More SFX - 2
- UI rework + actual design — 1

## Labeling and ML

- Snapshot Explorer — 5
  - Heuristics for clustering snapshots based on the board itsel (?)
- Unsupervised learning (press "Hold" = don't want that = negative signal?) — 2
- Different generators for pro and noob — 2 // lowered priority, too much data required
- Replace softmax with threshold + flatter normalization - 3
- Labeling gameification — 5

## Personalization

- User authentication + profile + stats — 3
- Personalized ML generators (this is a big one, but also a big one, you know...) — 3
